# Lmst - web client for Mastodon

Lmst is a web client for Mastodon that focuses on small size
and simple interface.

## How it's different

Lmst has very small bundle size - **up to 10 kB**, and this limit won't be increased in the future.
This is the mandatory requirement.

Also it has zero dependencies, so it won't suffer from a library that
became deprecated. As a consequence, lmst offers a very small subset
of features: 

- Follow/unfollow profile
- Write text-only statuses/replies
- Boost/unboost statuses
- Delete own statuses
