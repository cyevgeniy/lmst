# Lmst - web client for Mastodon

<p align="center"><img src="screenshots/logo.png" width="200"></p>

Lmst is a web client for Mastodon that focuses on small size
and simple interface.

## How it's different

- Small bundle size - **up to 10 kB**, and this limit won't be increased in the future.
  This is the mandatory requirement
- Classic, familiar ui layout. Lmst has simple ui, which reduces visual load on a user.
  It looks more like a website than a "web app".

Also it has zero dependencies, so it won't suffer from a library that
became deprecated. As a consequence, lmst offers a very small subset
of features: 

- Follow/unfollow profile
- Write text-only statuses/replies
- Boost/unboost statuses
- Search (profiles, statuses, hashtags)
- Delete own statuses
