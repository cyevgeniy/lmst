# Lmst - web client for Mastodon

<p align="center"><img src="screenshots/logo.png" width="200"></p>

Lmst is a web client for Mastodon that focuses on small size and simple
interface.

## How it's different

- Small JS bundle size - **up to 10 kB** brotlied, and this limit won't be
  increased in the future. This is the mandatory requirement.
- Classic, familiar ui layout. Lmst has simple ui, which reduces visual load on
  a user. It looks more like a website than a "web app".

Also it has zero dependencies, so it won't suffer from a library that became
deprecated. Even so, it offers basic functionality which may be enough for you:

- Follow/unfollow profiles
- Compose statuses/replies with image attachments
- Distraction-free compose mode (zen)
- Boost/unboost statuses
- Search (profiles, statuses, hashtags)
- Own statuses deletion
- View notifications
